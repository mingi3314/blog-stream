## Understanding the Stock Market

### Definition and Purpose

The stock market serves as a platform where publicly traded companies issue and trade shares of stock. This system enables companies to raise capital for various purposes, such as funding operations, expanding their business, or paying off debt. By purchasing shares, investors become partial owners of the company, entitling them to a portion of the company's profits.

### Major Stock Market Indices

Stock market indices, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ Composite, provide a snapshot of the overall health and performance of the stock market. These indices track the value of a basket of stocks, offering investors a way to gauge market trends and compare their portfolios to broader market performance.

### How Stocks are Traded

Stocks are primarily traded in two markets: the primary market and the secondary market. In the primary market, companies issue new shares to the public through initial public offerings (IPOs). Once shares are initially sold, subsequent trading occurs in the secondary market, where investors buy and sell shares among themselves. Brokers and trading platforms facilitate these transactions, enabling investors to access various marketplaces and execute trades.
