Opening a brokerage account involves several steps:

1. **Choose a broker:** Based on the factors mentioned above, select a broker that suits your needs.
2. **Provide personal information:** You'll need to share your name, address, Social Security number, and other details to open an account.
3. **Fund your account:** Transfer money from your bank account to your newly created brokerage account.
4. **Place trades:** With a funded account, you can now start buying and selling stocks according to your trading plan.
